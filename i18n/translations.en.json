With the release of version 1.4, SQLAlchemy added support for Asynchronous I/O for both its core and ORM features. This means that you can now use the popular SQL toolkit for Python in your asynchronous applications.",

Jukka Ruohonen, Kalle Hjerppe, and Kalle Rindell in their research paper “A Large-Scale Security-Oriented Static Analysis of Python Packages in PyPI” claimed that they scanned PyPI for security issues in Python packages and found the presence of at least one security issue in about 46% of the Python packages. In addition, security vulnerabilities can be present in the source code of the package. In this talk, we will address the security issues related to python packaging and possible solutions to make python packages secure. The talk begins with the importance of a secure package and vulnerabilities in the Python package index. Then, I will discuss Python packages such as Bandit for identifying common security issues in Python code and “safety” for dependency check.

              "p1": "Machine learning models are making predictions that affect people’s lives, so ensuring that they’re fair and unbiased must be an industry imperative. One way to ensure fairness is to discover a model’s mispredictions and analyze and fix the underlying causes. In this talk, we'll look at ways and try to understand the decisions of these models to ensure responsible machine learning. Additionally, we'll examine the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of these methods and discuss the road ahead. After all, it is not only enough to get accurate predictions but predictions that are fair and not discriminating."

        "p4": "Most open source software development happens on the web and developers usually communicate online only when working on projects. This usually works out fine, but the lack of live meetings can sometimes be a limiting factor in making good progress.",
        "p5": "For this reason, a form of impromptu coding meetups called “sprints” or “hackathons” (outside the Python community, the term “hackathon” is more common) were initiated, where developers interested in a project can get together for a short period of time to make quick progress. Since conferences provide the perfect occasion to meet, sprints are made part of the conference program."
